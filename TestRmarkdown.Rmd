## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
head(cars)
#Density plot
par(mfrow=c(1, 2))
plot(density(cars$speed), main="Density Plot: Speed", ylab="Frequency")
polygon(density(cars$speed), col="black")
plot(density(cars$dist), main="Density Plot: Distance", ylab="Frequency")
polygon(density(cars$dist), col="darkblue")
#Correlation
cor(cars$speed,cars$dist, method=c("pearson","kendall","spearman"))
#scatterplot
scatter.smooth(x=cars$speed, y=cars$dist)
scatter.smooth(x=cars$speed, y=cars$dist) 
x<-cars$speed
y<-cars$dist
line(x,y)
plot(x,y)
scatter.smooth(x, y, main="Dist ~ Speed")
#linear model
Model1 <- lm(formula = y~x, data = cars)
summary(Model1)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
dm<-matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8), nrow = 4, ncol = 2)
plot(dm)
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
